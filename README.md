Cons1k
======

This is a simple helper script which takes away the need for you to
remember which console port to use for which logical domain as
configured on a capable [OpenBSD/sparc64](http://openbsd.org/sparc64.html)
machine.

The console information is gathered from the _dmesg_ and console
sessions are managed in a [tmux](http://tmux.sf.net) window.
